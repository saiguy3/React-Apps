## About the App

This is a simple, 4-function (+, -, \*, /) calculator was created using React.

## How to Run

Download the folder open index.html in Google Chrome (should work on most other browsers).

## What I Learned

* More about React Components and working with onClick functions
* Learned how to use functional components to reduce noise and optimize performance

## Future Improvements

Given more time,
* I would add more functions and a decimal button
* Improve the UI and make it more responsive to the web page
